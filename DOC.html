                <h1 class="projectitle"> Dartmouth Outing Club Concept Platform </h1>
                <p><b>Summary:</b> The Dartmouth Outing Club has been a cornerstone of Dartmouth since its inception in
                    1909. While the DOC outdoor resources are extensive, they are currently underused by students and
                    faculty. We set out to create a platform that would integrate student’s experiences in the classroom
                    with outdoor exploration.</p>
                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Role:</b> UX designer and user research lead (team size: 3) </p>
                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Timeline:</b> 2 weeks (May 2017)</p>
                <p class="left-aligned"> <b>Context:</b> ENGS 12: Design Thinking class, final project</p>
                <p> <b>Description: </b> Our platform allows any professor to book DOC cabins for experiential learning
                    excursions, and provides the infrastructure for professors and students to interact and coordinate
                    necessary trip details. Increasing the prevalence of academic immersion in the outdoors will address
                    the white space that currently exists between the outdoors' potential for experiential learning and
                    the amount of students using DOC resources.
                </p>
                <p class="left-aligned"> <b>Challenge: </b> How might we make full use of Dartmouth’s manifold resources
                    by engaging
                    Dartmouth students in the outdoors?
                </p>
                <p class="left-aligned"> <b> User Research </b> </p>
                <img src="./images/UI:UX/DOC Project/FINAL ASSETS/UI/doc_user research panel.png" alt="user"
                    id="user-research" />
                <p> We conducted several rounds of interviews with 40 students, 10 faculty members, and 2
                    administrators, including Brian Kunz, DOC director..

                    We gathered two main insights:
                    1) Students face barriers of entry to the DOC and therefore don’t get enough opportunities to engage
                    with the outdoors at Dartmouth
                    2) Dartmouth and the DOC have amazing resources in terms of cabins and equipment. However, these
                    resources are currently underused by both students and faculty. </p>

                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Brainstorm</b></p>
                <p>To materialize our vision, the solution had to be:

                    Accessible: we wanted to make planning a trip easy so that spending time in the outdoors would be
                    more accessible for any student
                    Inclusive: open to all groups on campus
                    Relaxing & creative: the outdoors provide a great environment for students to get away from the
                    Dartmouth stress bubble and have room to be creative
                    Community-oriented: we envisioned an experience that would provide students and faculty an
                    opportunity to bond while exploring nature and learning in the outdoors. </p>

                <img src="./images/UI:UX/DOC Project/FINAL ASSETS/UI/doc_whitespace.png" alt="user"
                    id="user-research" />
                <p> We wanted to address the white space between the students who would benefit from the outdoors and
                    the DOC resources. By providing an experiential learning opportunity, we brainstormed creating a
                    platform that would reach a great number of students who would ideally have this experience two to
                    three times in their Dartmouth career. This would create a positive feedback loop and encourage
                    students to keep experiencing the outdoors on their own afterwards. </p>


                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Solution</b></p>
                <p>Our innovation was driven by our desire to make full use of these outdoor resources and open them up
                    to the whole campus. In short, we wanted to enrich students’ experience and well-being by engaging
                    in the Dartmouth outdoors.

                    With these insights in mind, we envisioned a platform that would provide professors and students
                    with the opportunity to easily organize immersive academic experiences in the outdoors. Our platform
                    would provide all the information needed for any faculty member to effectively plan an outdoor trip
                    for their students and expose them to a positive experience outside in nature. </p>

                <p><b>User Journey</b></p>

                <p><b>Web Platform</b></p>
                <img src="./images/UI:UX/DOC Project/FINAL ASSETS/UI/MacBook Landing Page -DOC.png" alt="painpoints"
                    id="white-space" />
                <img src="./images/UI:UX/DOC Project/FINAL ASSETS/UI/doc_login screen.png" alt="painpoints"
                    id="white-space" />
                <img src="./images/UI:UX/DOC Project/FINAL ASSETS/UI/doc_cabin page.png" alt="painpoints"
                    id="white-space" />
                <p> The platform would have a straightforward interface for professors to interact with. They would be
                    able to choose a date, time and whether they want to plan an overnight or a day trip.

                    Then, the available cabins during that timeframe would show on the screen. The professor would be
                    able to filter the options using filters such as distance from campus and capacity. We decided to
                    include the filter option based on our discussions with several professors.

                    The information about each cabin has already been compiled on the DOC website, so we envision that
                    our platform could potentially be incorporated with it in the future. </p>

                <img src="./images/UI:UX/DOC Project/FINAL ASSETS/UI/doc_trip page.png" alt="painpoints"
                    id="white-space" />
                <p> The organizer of the trip would be able to see the students in his class that are able to
                    participate as well as list the activities that will be included in the trip. The trip page will
                    also include a summary of the professor’s goals for the experiential learning adventure. </p>

                <img src="./images/UI:UX/DOC Project/FINAL ASSETS/UI/doc_calendar page.png" alt="painpoints"
                    id="white-space" />
                <p>Lastly, the calendar feature on the right would showcase other trips that are going out at similar
                    times and thus the academic immersion could become interdisciplinary.</p>

                <p>Stakeholders (Students, Professors, DOC Administrators)</p>

                <p><b>Administrators</b></p>
                <p>“Streamlining a menu that you could quickly put together [these trips with]... the logistics don’t
                    have to be overwhelming” – Brian, DOC Director</p>

                <p><b>Students</b></p>
                <p>“I’m just so busy all the time…. If it were built into the curriculum I’d do it” –K.K. ‘20</p>

                <p><b>Professors</b></p>
                <p>“What [these trips] lack is the bonding experience… in the FSP, we spend a lot of time reflecting on
                    ourselves and the community, and that doesn’t happen in normal field trips” –C.H. Geography
                </p>
                <p>“When I organize my trips, it’s a huge hassle on my end because I don’t go through the DOC because I
                    need cabins close to water masses… this is a great idea, but make sure it encompasses specific
                    academic needs beyond building community to incentivize the sciences to do this” – E.O. Earth
                    Sciences</p>

                <p> “The only problem is you can’t make [these trips] mandatory, so you always have a few stragglers… I
                    keep doing them because its worth it for those involved” – E.O. Earth Sciences</p>

                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Reflection</b></p>
                <p>Next Steps
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    1) Develop and design the actual web application: establish a partnership with DALI Lab
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2) Faculty and student buy-in: promote the platform to professors and students and engage as many
                    academic departments as possible
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3) Build stronger relationships with the DOC trip leaders, who would help facilitate some of these
                    trips in the future
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4) Extend to other on-campus groups: in the future, we envision that our platform would cater to
                    student groups on campus such as acapella groups, dance groups, the Greek system, the House system,
                    etc. Ideally, the amazing Dartmouth outdoor resources would open up to any and all groups on campus
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5) Expand beyond cabins: immersive learning in the outdoors could make use of other resources that
                    the DOC has to offer
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    6) Interdisciplinary: different academic departments would be able to coordinate trips together;
                    e.g. the film and theatre departments could spend an afternoon together working on a film short
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    7) tests are outdoors: by taking advantage on the mental health benefits that the outdoor provides,
                    in the future our platform could help alleviate exam stress (i.e. oral exams could take place in a
                    relaxing environment in a cabin)</p>
