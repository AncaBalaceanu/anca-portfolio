                <p><b>Summary:</b> The overall goal of Impact Design is to contribute to a more empathetic view of
                    marginalized communities. This term, our team set out to better understand the unique challenges
                    faced by Caity, a student at the Hartford Autism Regional Program (HARP). Impact Design partnered
                    with HARP to create delight experiences for eight kids in the program. </p>
                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Role:</b> team member (team size: 4) </p>
                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Timeline:</b> 10 weeks (September - November 2018)</p>
                <p class="left-aligned"> <b>Context:</b> Impact Design Class and Social Impact Practicum</p>
                <p> <b>Description: </b> Utilizing the emerging science of delight and the design thinking process, we
                    created Caityland, an interactive life-size board game centered around Caity’s love for pigs that
                    would bring her delight and help advance HARP’s learning objectives for her. Progression from one
                    tile to the next requires physical and/or verbal responses to audio prompts that are played through
                    a plush pig. Caity’s interaction with the game allows her to practice producing longer verbal
                    utterances, thinking independently and staying active.
                </p>
                <p class="left-aligned"> <b>Impact: </b> By combining the educational with the delightful, we aimed to
                    provide a game with long-lasting impact on Caity’s learning goals while bringing delight to her
                    daily life.
                </p>
                <p class="left-aligned"> <b> User Research </b> </p>
                <img src="./images/Product Design/Caityland/Project Images/UI/User Research Panel.png" alt=" user"
                    id="user-research" />
                <p> Through our first meeting with Caity at HARP, we were able to collect a number of insights based on
                    observations and direct interactions with both Caity and Jessica Poludin, the director of HARP, that
                    allowed our team to better understand the individual for whom we would be designing a delightful
                    product and experience. </p>

                <p> With all of this in mind, we asked ourselves, “How might we delight Caity while reinforcing HARP’s
                    goals?”. Some of the HARP goals for Caity were promoting independent thinking, helping her be more
                    physically active and increase the length of her verbal utterances.
                </p>

                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Brainstorming, Building, Learning</b></p>
                <img src="./images/Product Design/Caityland/Project Images/UI/Prototype 1 Panel.png" alt=" user"
                    id="user-research" />
                <p> Our first prototype, “Caity’s Adventure,” is an interactive storybook centered around Caity and her
                    pet pig, Bob. The book was designed to be used whenever she might want to engage in a low-energy
                    activity with the goal of improving Caity’s decision-making skills and independence. “Caity’s
                    Adventure” includes tactile elements (such as patches of fuzzy material on the pages) and liftable
                    flaps on pages where the story would prompt Caity with a choice. It also has an audio component,
                    where the final product would read the story to Caity as she turned the pages. In our prototype, we
                    used a pre-recorded external speaker to simulate this idea. </p>

                <img src="./images/Product Design/Caityland/Project Images/UI/Prototype 2 Panel.png" alt=" user"
                    id="user-research" />
                <p> We saw an opportunity to elevate transition periods since they are a frequent part of Caity’s
                    routine and thus hoped to bring delight to them. The second prototype is called “Dance, Dance,
                    Transition,” which is an intersection of popular games Dance, Dance, Revolution and Just Dance. We
                    created a colorful mat from foam core, construction paper, and glow sticks. A playlist was curated
                    with low-, medium-, and high-energy songs with accompanying dancing videos. The idea was that songs
                    would play in decreasing energy to ease her transition into something calmer, while still including
                    something she enjoyed: dancing. </p>



                <img src="./images/Product Design/Caityland/Project Images/UI/Prototype 3 Panel.png" alt="user"
                    id="user-research" />
                <p> For our third prototype, we drew from Caity’s liking of pets and created a series of games centered
                    around a tactile orb. Our idea was to provide her with a sensory experience in the form of a ball
                    covered in different fur-like fuzzy materials paired with group-based games that could be played by
                    passing the ball around. Testing the tactile orb with Caity revealed that she loved having structure
                    to her games and liked playing with others. She was also receptive to the soft, tactile element of
                    the orb and prefered the patches of fuzzy pink fabrics. However, we noticed that some of the games
                    were too complex and required a lot of additional explanation from Jessica. Moving forward, we
                    wanted to create something with simple instructions that required a little less effort from her
                    caregiver. </p>

                <img src="./images/Product Design/Caityland/Project Images/UI/Key insights.png" alt="user"
                    id="user-research" />

                <p>
                    In testing all three of the aforementioned prototypes with Caity, we realized that we had not yet
                    hit her ‘delight spot,’ but had learned important information from each prototype we tested. When
                    viewed collectively, we realized that anything we created for Caity should incorporate an aspect of
                    Bob doing silly things, as this elicited a strong response of joy and laughter from Caity with the
                    interactive storybook. Additionally, our final product should have a social, multi-person component
                    like that of Dance, Dance, Transition and the Tactile Orb while also incorporating elements of a
                    structured game. Thus, we went back to the whiteboard, mind-mapped and brainstormed (a lot) more,
                    and created Caityland.


                </p>

                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Final Product</b></p>
                <img src="./images/Product Design/Caityland/Project Images/UI/product picture.png" alt=" user"
                    id="user-research" />
                <p> Caityland is an interactive life-size board game centered around Caity’s favorite sidekick pig, Bob.
                    Progression from one tile to the next requires physical and/or verbal responses to audio prompts
                    that are played from a plush pig. The following sections delve deeper into the description and
                    justification of each component of Caityland. </p>

                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Specifications</b></p>
                <img src="./images/Product Design/Caityland/Project Images/UI/feature spec - tile.png" alt=" user"
                    id="user-research" />
                <p> Each tile was made from four 12’’ x 12’’ EVA foam tiles that we secured together with clear,
                    child-safe glue, making each tile was 24’’ x 24’’ x 0.4’’. Each tile has a vibrant, silly action
                    illustration of cartoon Bob. The illustrations were hand-drawn and hand-painted and made waterproof
                    with a coating. The tiles interlock and are lightweight, making it simple to assemble and also
                    customizable so Caity can experience the game differently each time. The high density foam
                    comfortably decreases stress on her joints as she jumps and dances on the tiles. There is a even
                    slip resistant advantage to prevent injuries. Some examples of our tiles include Bob sleeping,
                    swimming, eating pizza, playing in mud, and dressed as a superhero or princess.
                </p>

                <img src="./images/Product Design/Caityland/Project Images/UI/feature spec - pig.png" alt=" user"
                    id="user-research" />
                <p> Caity’s pet pig, Bob, was our inspiration for providing her a plush version that would guide her
                    through the Caityland experience through the push of a button connected to a recording/playback
                    device placed inside the toy pig. The rationale behind plush Bob was the following: firstly, we
                    wanted to ease the burden of explaining the game instructions for the HARP staff; secondly, we
                    created 28 different recordings to help Caity think independently by answering questions and
                    completing action-oriented prompts (see Appendix A); thirdly, we wanted to offer Caity a “little Bob
                    of her own”, in Jessica’s words, that would be at her side during the activity and provide delight
                    while reinforcing HARP goals for longer utterances, physical movement and independent thinking. </p>

                <p>
                    The instructions have no predetermined connection to the illustrations on the tiles because our goal
                    was to keep the game simple and to provide Caity with a different experience each time. The prompts
                    range from “What is Bob doing?” and “Do a silly dance” to “What makes you laugh?” and “Baa! What
                    animal makes that sound?” We kept in mind Caity’s liking of animal sounds, dance parties, and silly
                    things in order to motivate her to stay engaged with Caityland.

                <p class="left-aligned"><b>Crafting the Product Delivery Experience for Caity</b></p>
                <img src="./images/Product Design/Caityland/Project Images/UI/delivery experience photo.png" alt=" user"
                    id="user-research" />

                <p>Drawing from the lessons we learned by creating delightful experiences for our Impact Design
                    classmates, we crafted the final delivery experience for Caity with the same care and attention to
                    detail. The three main pillars of our experience were: the space, the product, and the people.
                    We decorated the room with fairy string lights cascading on the main wall and demarcating the
                    entrance. Our goal was to transport Caity into a space of delight and immerse her into the world of
                    Caityland right when she walked into the room. Additionally, we had a bluetooth speaker and played
                    her favorite songs in the background both as she came in and also during the activities associated
                    with the game.</p>
                <p>Caityland was laid out on the ground in an order that would ensure Caity’s final tile to be “dancing
                    Bob” illustration so that we would celebrate her completion of the game with a dance party. We
                    decided to reveal plush Bob to her as a wrapped gift and her excitement and suspense while opening
                    the box were heart-warming. She was exhilarated to see plush Bob and was eager to start playing the
                    game right away.</p>
                <p>As far as our team was concerned, we all wore tutus and pink because we knew Caity loved girly
                    things. Each of us had specific roles that would encourage Caity to stay engaged with the game,
                    namely guiding her, cheering her on, and videorecording the entire encounter.
                    Since the game itself is an experience, we did not want to overwhelm Caity with too many stimulating
                    elements. However, since we knew how much she loved playing with balloons, we did bring in helium
                    balloons at the end to mark her accomplishment of finishing the game. Lastly, we provided a
                    personalized plastic zip bag with handles to allow HARP staff to easily store and carry Caityland.</p>

                    <p>	This term has been an incredible period of growth for our team. Coming into this project, we did not know what to expect nor how we would be able to overcome ideas of ‘cheap delight’ such that we could create a product and experience that both delighted Caity and reinforced her HARP learning goals from HARP. However, by ensuring that whatever we created satisfied these two conditions, our team found that learning and delight can go hand in hand. </p>
                    <p>Delight is a unique emotion that is the result of positive prediction error, so by creating a game that had multiple components of randomness and variability (i.e. the tile order can be changed and the 28 audio prompts are all different), our final product could be used again and again to bring Caity delight while also helping her increase the length of her verbal utterances and reinforce her ability to listen and respond to prompts on her own.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, one of the main takeaways from this experience was that there is huge value in finding points of laughter and leveraging what is silly. As Dartmouth students, it can be easy to focus on creating products and experiences that are serious and formal reflections of classroom learning. However, in realizing how much Caity loved seeing Bob, her sidekick pig, doing activities not typical for a pig, such as cooking spaghetti or playing basketball, we were really able to create a customized product for Caity centered around things she truly loved rather than things we thought she might like.</p>
                    <p>Finally, in reflecting on this term, it is clear to see now how each failed prototype led to our final success with Caityland. At the time, though, it sometimes felt like we were flailing and unsure of what direction to go in next. Taking this into consideration, one of the most takeaways from Impact Design was that the human-centered design process really does work. By trusting ourselves and by trusting the HCD process, we were able to more effectively learn from each prototype, extract insights, and apply them to a final product that is completely different⏤in a good way⏤from anything our team thought we would create this term! </p>
